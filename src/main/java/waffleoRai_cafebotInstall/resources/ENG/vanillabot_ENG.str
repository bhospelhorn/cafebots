#Standard help 1
Greetings! My name is %s, a Java bot created to help with schedule management!
Below, you will find our current menu of commands available for standard server members. Upon issuing a valid command, I or one of the other server café bots will see to it that you are helped!

#Standard help 2
All café bots are capable of recognizing ! prefixed commands. If you prefix a command with !, then either a random café bot or the bot most appropriate for the job you are requesting will answer. You may also issue a command by pinging a particular café bot. If the bot recognizes the command, then the bot you specified will fulfill your request. If the individual bot you pinged does not recognize the command, it will delegate your command to the bot that does.
